slkbuild: arch-like wrapper script for easy slackware packaging

This is a utility to build packages for Slackware and derivatives
through the use of makepkg.

Please note root access is required. Use of fakeroot for running
slkbuild is advised. Read the man pages slkbuild(8) and SLKBUILD(5)
for more details on this tool.

 BE CAREFUL when adjusting build files as they could potentially harm your
 system if not done properly, especially when running as root!

Requirements: pkgtools, fakeroot(optional)
